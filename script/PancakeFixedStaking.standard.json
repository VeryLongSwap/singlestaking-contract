Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```solidity\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
